| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| | _ideation.md_ | |
| • In-class workshop | Workshopped in-class ✅ |  |
| • Audiences | Audiences are listed—it looks like you decided upon a composite audience rather than one of the listed ones. That’s acceptable, but ideally it would have been more explicitly stated (–1) | 4/5 |
| • Ten (10) needs | Ten needs are stated sufficiently | 10/10 |
| • Three (3) projects | Three possible projects are listed | 6/6 |
| • Three (3) sets of goals/ideas | Each project has goals/ideas attached to it | 6/6 |
| • Project choice | A winning project/app is indicated | 3/3 |
| • Content-completion | _ideation.md_ not committed in its final form until 12/12 (the version committed before 11/13 did not match the specified content)<br><br>However, you did participate in the ideation process itself so we will deduct solely for not committing by the specified date (–2) | -2 |
| | _pitch.md_ | |
| • Inspiration statement | Inspiration statement is provided—not quite phrased according to what is specified in Dr. Toal’s [ideation process page](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/ideation/) but is sufficiently audience-centric to work | 8/8 |
| • Possible alternative solutions | Possible solutions are given | 6/6 |
| • Chosen fleshed-out idea | Final app idea is fleshed out sufficiently | 6/6 |
| • In-class presentation | Pitch delivered in-class ✅ | /4 |
| • Content-completion | _pitch.md_ not committed in its final form until 12/12. However, you did pitch in class on the designated day so we will deduct solely for not committing by the specified date (–2) | -2 |
| | _about.md_ | |
| • Project title | Title is provided | 2/2 |
| • Deployed public link | Link to functional public deployment is provided | 2/2 |
| • Team names and roles | Team member (just one!) is listed, and as such we’ll consider your roles to be implicitly known 😁 | 8/8 |
| • Audience and their needs | Audience and their needs are explained | 8/8 |
| • Screenshots/video/demo | Demo screenshots are provided | 10/10 |
| • Technology highlights | Technology details are provided | 10/10 |
| • Credits | No explicit credits are provided, but the API used is mentioned and there appears to be no need for further mentions |  |
| • In-class prsentation | Final presentation successfully delivered in class 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 |  |
| | **Baseline functionality** | |
| • Third-party web service API | API functionality works. Good job using OpenAIs API. (+3) | 13/10 |
| • Authentication | Authentication done via Google Auth. | 10/10 |
| • Database | Firestore implementation meets criteria. | 10/10 |
| **Baseline code quality** | Firebase and OpenAPI operations are not abstracted at all, instead being invoked directly by React component code. These should have been “plain” functions imported from a service, as shown by the code presented in class and in feedback already given to you previously (–10) | 30/40 |
| **Design & usability** | No error handling present (–5). Loading present when API queried but not for things like grabbing from the firestore. (–2) | 33/40 |
| **Code maintainability** | Besides the lack of abstraction of API and firestore functions, maintainability meets criteria. |  |
| **Code readability** | Code readability meets criteria.   |  |
| **Version control** | Version control sufficient. |  |
| **Punctuality** | Last commit 12/13 1:35am. On time. |  |
| | **Total** | **181/200** |

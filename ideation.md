# Project Ideation Document

## Project Overview

### Title
- Research Lab Management Web Application

### Description
- A web application tailored for computer science research labs to manage undergraduate researchers, their tasks, progress, and facilitate communication and documentation.

## Key Features

### 1. Project Management
- **Functionality**: Allows research advisors to create, assign, and track tasks and projects for undergraduate researchers.
- **Implementation**:
  - React front-end for intuitive UI.
  - Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage and retrieval of project details.
  - Custom components for displaying projects and tasks with deadlines and progress indicators.

### 2. Chat Feature
- **Functionality**: Real-time chat for communication among lab members.
- **Implementation**:
  - React components for chat interface.
  - Firebase Realtime Database for instant messaging capabilities.
  - Authentication and user management with Firebase Authentication.

### 3. Documentation
- **Functionality**: Platform for creating, editing, and sharing project documentation and notes.
- **Implementation**:
  - Integration of a rich-text editor in React.
  - Firebase Storage for document storage and management.
  - Collaborative editing features (optional stretch goal).

## Technical Stack

### Front-End
- **Framework**: React.js
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux (if needed for complex state management).
- **Styling**: CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI.

### Back-End
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Real-Time Data Handling**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage

## Security Considerations
